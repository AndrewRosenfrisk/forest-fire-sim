# Forest Fire Sim

## About

This simulation shows a forest whose trees are constantly growing and then being 
burned down. On each step of the simulation, there is a 1 percent chance that a 
blank space grows into a tree and a 1 percent chance that a tree is struck by lightning 
and burns. Fires will spread to adjacent trees, so a densely packed forest is more likely 
to suffer a larger fire than a sparsely packed one. This simulation was inspired by 
Nicky Caseâ€™s Emoji Sim at http://ncase.me/simulating/model/.
